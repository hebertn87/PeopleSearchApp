PersonSearch
How to run:

1. Download, extract and open master in visual studio.
2. Open search.html.
3. Build and run project in debug mode.

Current functionality contains: HTML page that contains forms for searching the database, forms for adding new People into the database, an ORM database that can be inserted into, and a controller that has both a GET request and a POST request. This also includes the AngularJS file located at Scripts/App.js that contains the AngularJS that talks with the controller. Unit tests deemed unecessary as html served as testing for both controller and angularJS.

Non working code: Searching the database by name and Displaying the data in HTML is not implemented, but is pretty straightforward in implementing.
